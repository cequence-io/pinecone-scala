This is a ready-to-fork, example/demo project demonstrating how to use [Pinecone](https://pinecone.io) vector database with [OpenAI](https://openai.com) embeddings in Scala using [Pinecone Scala Client](https://github.com/cequence-io/pinecone-scala) and [OpenAI Scala Client](https://github.com/cequence-io/openai-scala-client).

The demo app can be found in [PineconeOpenAIDemo](./src/main/scala/io/cequence/pineconeopenai/demo/PineconeOpenAIDemo.scala).
The following env. variables are expected:
- `PINECONE_SCALA_CLIENT_API_KEY`
- `PINECONE_SCALA_CLIENT_ENV`
- `OPENAI_SCALA_CLIENT_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_SCALA_CLIENT_ORG_ID` (optional)

**‚úîÔ∏è Important**: The demo uses data from [Trec dataset](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/Data/QA/QC/) created by Cognitive Computation Group at University of Pennsylvania, which we hereby acknowledge. Its training part is included in this project at [trec-train.json](./src/main/resources/trec-train.json) (downloaded using [this script](./src/main/resources/trec-dump.py)).
